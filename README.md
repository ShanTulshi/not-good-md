# Not Good Markdown Editor

Just a small experiment with rendering Markdown ([GitHub flavored](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) documents real-time, for my own use as a personal scratchpad and a place I could prototype documents I had to write at work. I hope you find it useful too! 

#### What I've built off:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Showdown JS](http://showdownjs.com/)
- [Pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)
